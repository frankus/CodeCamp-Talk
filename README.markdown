What's Where?
-------------

The `/books` directory contains the complete rails app. Depending on your version of rails (this was built with 2.2.2 on Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard), it should run locally on port 3000 simply by changing to the `books` directory in Terminal and typing `script/server`. 

The `/MobileBooks` directory contains the Xcode project, minus the build directory. You should be able to compile it using any 3.x iPhone SDK. 

In the `Classes` subdirectory of the `MobileBooks` project, you'll find a roughly 1.1-version copy of the ObjectiveResource library that you can copy into your project. 

Thanks, and don't hesitate to contact me with questions.
